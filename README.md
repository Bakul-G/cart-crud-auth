# Title: CRUD operations on Shopping Cart and Authentication using Node.js

## Description
The shopping cart is a primary feature of the project, and it updates dynamically without requiring the entire page to be reloaded. You can add, update, or delete products without a full page refresh using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (**AJAX**). AJAX enables us to communicate with remote servers asynchronously, and we can use AJAX calls to dynamically request data from web servers. jQuery, a JavaScript framework, simplifies AJAX implementation, which is utilized in this project.

This project involves three interconnected database models: Users, Products, and Cart, which make up the core functionality of the platform.

Passport.js implements a local strategy for authentication, and authentication errors are appropriately handled on both the frontend and backend.
